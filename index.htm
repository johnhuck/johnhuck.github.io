To answer these questions, an overview of current practice was undertaken. Eighteen audio-oriented online collections were identified and sample records from each were examined to discover the character of the metadata elements used in each collection. The results were interpreted both in the context of  individual collections and on  an aggregate level. The findings provide a new perspective on the interdisciplinary nature of online audio-oriented collections and their metadata requirements.</em></p>    </td>  </tr></table><p align="center" class="style1"><a href="http://www.slis.ualberta.ca/">School of Library and Information Studies</a><a href="http://www.ualberta.ca/"><br />University of Alberta</a></p></body></html>
